## Overview

Property Scout is a sophisticated, AI-powered web application designed to provide users with a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of a potential home purchase. It goes beyond simple mortgage calculators by synthesizing personal financial data, real-time market trends, and hyper-local neighborhood information to answer the critical question: "Is this a wise home buying decision for me, right now?"

The application is built with a modern frontend stack and leverages the Google Gemini API for its powerful analytical capabilities.

## Our Development Process: Cary's Foundational Frame (CFF)

This project is managed using a unique, simulated Software Development Lifecycle called **Cary's Foundational Frame (CFF)**. This is a hybrid waterfall/agile methodology designed for rapid, high-quality, and well-documented development.

Our process is built on the principle of **"#lift_from_the_bottom to #build_the_top,"** ensuring every piece of work is planned and validated before execution begins.

Key artifacts of our process include:

- **A living `ROADMAP.md`** for high-level strategic planning.
- **A `dockets/` directory** containing all formal project documentation, including bug reports, QA reports, and architectural plans.
- **A `dockets/STANDARDS.md` file** that codifies our commitment to excellence in UI/UX and code architecture.

For a complete overview of our methodology, please see the [**CFF Protocol Document**](./dockets/CFF_PROTOCOL.md).
