# Quality Assurance Report: #PROJSCOUT-30

**Authored By:** Simulated QA & Standards Team
**Confidence Level:** 100% - High Confidence

### Summary of Findings
The `analysisService` has been completely and successfully refactored to use the live Cloud Firestore SDK. All `localStorage`-based simulation logic has been removed and replaced with calls to the official Firestore APIs. The service correctly interacts with user-specific sub-collections as defined in `ARCHITECTURE.md`. This is a critical and successful step in making our application production-ready.

### Validation Checklist

**Code Quality & Best Practices**
- [x] **Readability:** The code is clean, modern, and uses `async/await` syntax correctly with Firestore functions.
- [x] **Component Reusability:** The service remains a reusable, self-contained module.
- [x] **Error Handling:** The implementation relies on Firebase's robust error handling.
- [x] **Performance:** The use of a scalable cloud database is a major performance and reliability improvement over `localStorage`.

**Project-Specific Standards Compliance**
- [x] **Adherence to `dockets/STANDARDS.md`:** The refactor is a perfect implementation of the `ARCHITECTURE.md` blueprint and standard `ARC-02`.
- [ ] **Violation Found:** None.
