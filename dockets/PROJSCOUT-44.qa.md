# Quality Assurance Report: #PROJSCOUT-44

**Authored By:** Simulated QA & Standards Team
**Confidence Level:** 20% - Blocked by Critical Defects

---

### Summary of Findings
The production build currently fails and the generative AI service configuration is not viable for a browser-based Vite app. These issues prevent the feature from running, so confidence remains very low until the blockers are resolved.

### Blocking Issues
1. **Missing `@google/genai` runtime dependency (Critical):** `src/services/geminiService.ts` imports `@google/genai`, but the package is not declared in `package.json`. The Vite build fails immediately with an unresolved module error, so no bundle can be produced. 【F:src/services/geminiService.ts†L1-L5】【93153d†L1-L18】
2. **Unusable API key lookup in the browser (Critical):** The Gemini service initializes the client with `process.env.API_KEY`. Vite replaces environment variables via `import.meta.env`, and the browser has no `process` shim, so this call throws at runtime even if the package were available. 【F:src/services/geminiService.ts†L1-L6】
