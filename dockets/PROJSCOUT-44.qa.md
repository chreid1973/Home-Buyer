### Summary of Findings
The critical, systemic failure causing foundational instability has been definitively resolved. The team has verified the following:
1.  The `index.html` file now contains a clean and correct import map with the latest library versions.
2.  The entire project file structure has been restored. There are no missing or empty files.
3.  The application now loads and runs **without any startup errors.**

This was a successful and comprehensive restoration. The foundation is now considered stable and robust. This blocker is resolved.
