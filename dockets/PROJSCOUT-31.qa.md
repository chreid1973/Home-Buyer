# Quality Assurance Report: #PROJSCOUT-31

**Authored By:** Simulated QA & Standards Team
**Confidence Level:** 100% - High Confidence

---

### Summary of Findings
The bug related to incorrect data coupling has been successfully resolved. The `geminiService` no longer adds persistence-specific fields, and the `AnalysisResult` type has been correctly updated to reflect that `id` and `savedAt` are optional. This is a significant improvement to our data model and architectural integrity.

### Validation Checklist

**Code Quality & Best Practices**
- [x] **Readability:** The code in both `geminiService` and `analysisService` is now cleaner and more logically separated.
- [x] **Component Reusability:** N/A.
- [x] **Error Handling:** N/A.
- [x] **Performance:** No impact on performance.

**Project-Specific Standards Compliance**
- [x] **Adherence to `dockets/STANDARDS.md`:** This change strongly enforces our `ARC-02` (Centralized Services) standard by ensuring services have distinct and separate responsibilities.
- [ ] **Violation Found:** None.
