### Title
Critical Error: Firebase SDK Import Mismatch Causes "does not provide an export named 'default'"

### Description
The application fails to load immediately upon startup with a fatal error in the browser console: `Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module 'firebase/app' does not provide an export named 'default'`. This error completely blocks the application from rendering and prevents any user interaction.

### Steps to Reproduce
1.  Load the application in a web browser.
2.  Open the developer console.
3.  **Expected Result:** The application's main screen should render correctly, allowing the user to start an analysis or log in.
4.  **Actual Result:** A blank screen is rendered, and a fatal JavaScript error is thrown in the console, halting all script execution.

### Root Cause Analysis
The root cause is an incompatibility between the Firebase code in the application and the Firebase libraries being loaded. The application code is written using the Firebase v8 namespaced API (`import firebase from 'firebase/app'`), which expects a default export. However, the `importmap` in `index.html` was loading the modern Firebase v9+ modular SDKs, which use named exports and do not have a default export. This mismatch caused the module loader to fail.

### Resolution
The `importmap` in `index.html` has been modified to resolve the incompatibility. The paths for all Firebase services (`firebase/app`, `firebase/auth`, `firebase/firestore`) now point to their respective v9 **compatibility libraries** (e.g., `app-compat`). These compat libraries are specifically designed to provide the v8-style API surface while using the modern SDK internally, thus bridging the gap and resolving the import error without requiring a full rewrite of the application code.
