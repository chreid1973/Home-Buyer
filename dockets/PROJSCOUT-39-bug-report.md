### Title
Critical Error: Failed to resolve module specifier due to inconsistent file structure and invalid import paths.

### Description
The application fails to load immediately upon startup with a fatal error in the browser console, such as `Uncaught TypeError: Failed to resolve module specifier "@/services/authService"`. This error completely blocks the application from rendering and is caused by a disorganized project file structure.

### Steps to Reproduce
1.  Load the application in a web browser.
2.  Open the developer console.
3.  **Expected Result:** The application's main screen should render correctly.
4.  **Actual Result:** A blank screen is rendered, and a fatal JavaScript module resolution error is thrown in the console, halting all script execution.

### Root Cause Analysis
The root cause is an inconsistent project file structure where application source code exists in both the root directory and the `src/` directory. This has led to two primary issues:
1.  **Incorrect Relative Paths:** Components were trying to import services and types using relative paths (e.g., `../services/authService`) that were incorrect for their location in the file tree.
2.  **Unsupported Alias:** At least one import was using a path alias (`@/`) which is not supported by the browser's native module loader or the `importmap` configuration, requiring a build tool for resolution.

### Resolution
A comprehensive sweep of the entire application was performed to correct all module import paths. All imports have been standardized to correctly point to the canonical source files located within the `src/` directory (e.g., `../src/services/authService`, `../src/types`). This makes the application runnable with its current file structure. A proactive docket has also been suggested to properly consolidate all source files into the `src/` directory to prevent this issue from recurring.
