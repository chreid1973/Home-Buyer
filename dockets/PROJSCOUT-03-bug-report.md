### Title
Inconsistent Coloring for "Balanced" Market Health

### Description
There is a visual inconsistency in how a "Balanced" market health index is represented. The `VerdictExplainer.tsx` component correctly displays a yellow color, but the `Results.tsx` component's "Market Health Index" display defaults to a purple color for the same condition.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Generate an analysis where the AI returns a `marketHealthIndex` between 5.0 and 6.0.
2. Navigate to the "Market Analysis & Forecasts" section on the `Results` page.
3. Observe the "Market Health Index" score.
4. **Expected Result:** The numerical score (e.g., "5.5/10") should be rendered in a yellow color to indicate a "Balanced" market, consistent with standard UI indicators.
5. **Actual Result:** The numerical score is rendered in the default purple color, which does not correctly convey the market state and violates our UI standard `UI-01`.

### Root Cause Analysis
The `getRecommendationStyle` utility function in `Results.tsx` was being used to color the Market Health Index. This function's logic did not include a condition to handle the string "balanced". When the ternary operator passed "balanced" to the function, none of the `if` conditions matched, causing it to fall through to the default purple color.

### Resolution
The `getRecommendationStyle` function in `Results.tsx` has been updated. The condition `lowerRec.includes('balanced')` has been added to the logic block that returns the yellow color style. This ensures that a "Balanced" market state is always rendered in yellow, creating visual consistency across the application.
