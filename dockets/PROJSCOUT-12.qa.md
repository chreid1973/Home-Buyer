**Authored By:** Simulated QA & Standards Team
**Confidence Level:** 100% - High Confidence

### Summary of Findings
The authentication service and UI have been successfully integrated into the main `App.tsx` component. The application now correctly manages a `currentUser` state, persists login across page reloads, and conditionally renders the UI based on authentication status. The logic is sound and well-implemented.
