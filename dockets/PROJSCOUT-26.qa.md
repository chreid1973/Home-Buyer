# Quality Assurance Report: #PROJSCOUT-26

**Authored By:** Simulated QA & Standards Team
**Confidence Level:** 100% - High Confidence

---

### Summary of Findings
The `authService` has been completely and successfully refactored to use the live Firebase Authentication SDK. All `localStorage`-based simulation logic has been removed and replaced with calls to the official Firebase APIs. The service now provides more user-friendly error messages based on Firebase error codes. This is a critical step in making our application production-ready.

### Validation Checklist

**Code Quality & Best Practices**
- [x] **Readability:** The code is clean, modern, and uses `async/await` syntax correctly.
- [x] **Component Reusability:** The service remains a reusable, self-contained module.
- [x] **Error Handling:** Error handling is significantly improved, catching specific Firebase errors and translating them into user-friendly messages.
- [x] **Performance:** No negative impact on performance.

**Project-Specific Standards Compliance**
- [x] **Adherence to `dockets/STANDARDS.md`:** The refactor is a perfect implementation of the `ARCHITECTURE.md` blueprint and `ARC-02`. The proactive inclusion of the `uid` in the User object is noted as a positive contribution that aligns with `ARC-01`.
- [ ] **Violation Found:** None.
