### Title
Critical Error: "Could not find root element to mount to" Prevents Application Startup

### Description
The application fails to load immediately upon startup with a fatal error in the browser console: `Uncaught Error: Could not find root element to mount to`. This error completely blocks the React application from rendering, resulting in a blank screen.

### Steps to Reproduce
1.  Load the application in a web browser.
2.  Open the developer console.
3.  **Expected Result:** The application's "Hero" screen should render correctly.
4.  **Actual Result:** A blank screen is rendered, and a fatal JavaScript error is thrown from `index.tsx`, halting all script execution.

### Root Cause Analysis
The root cause is a corrupted or incomplete `index.html` file. The `ReactDOM.createRoot()` method in `index.tsx` requires an HTML element with the ID `root` to exist in the DOM at the time the script is executed. The provided file state had an `index.html` file that was missing the essential `<div id="root"></div>` element, causing the `document.getElementById('root')` call to return `null` and the application to throw the fatal error.

### Resolution
The `index.html` file has been completely rebuilt from the ground up to be correct and robust. The fix includes:
1.  A standard HTML5 document structure.
2.  The critical `<div id="root"></div>` element placed within the `<body>`.
3.  The main script (`index.tsx`) is now loaded at the end of the `<body>` to ensure the DOM is parsed before the script runs.
4.  The full, correct `importmap` and all necessary global styles and fonts have been restored.

This definitively resolves the issue and restores the application's core entry point to a stable state.
