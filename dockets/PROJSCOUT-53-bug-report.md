**Severity:** CRITICAL - Blocker

### Title
Critical Error: "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'decision')"

### Description
The application crashes when the AI service returns an incomplete or malformed `AnalysisResult` object. Specifically, if the `result.verdict` property is missing, the `Results` component attempts to access `verdict.decision` and throws a fatal TypeError, resulting in a broken UI.

### Steps to Reproduce
1.  Generate an analysis where the Gemini API, for any reason (e.g., content filtering, network error, model hallucination), returns a JSON object that is missing the `verdict` property.
2.  The application transitions to the "results" view.
3.  **Expected Result:** The application should detect the malformed data and display a user-friendly error message, allowing the user to try again.
4.  **Actual Result:** The application crashes with a fatal JavaScript error (`Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'decision')`), resulting in a blank or broken UI that the user cannot recover from without reloading the page.

### Root Cause Analysis
The root cause is a lack of defensive coding and data validation in the `Results.tsx` component. The component implicitly trusted that the `result` prop would always be a perfectly formed `AnalysisResult` object. It did not validate the presence of critical nested properties before passing them down to child components (`VerdictReveal`, etc.), leading to the crash when the data structure was incomplete.

### Resolution
A definitive architectural improvement has been implemented in `Results.tsx`:
1.  **Data Validation:** A new validation function, `isAnalysisResultValid`, has been added. Before any rendering occurs, this function performs a rigorous check to ensure all critical top-level properties of the `result` object are present and not null/undefined.
2.  **Graceful Error Handling:** If the `isAnalysisResultValid` check fails, the component no longer attempts to render the results. Instead, it renders a full-screen, user-friendly error message, styled consistently with our theme. This message informs the user that the AI returned incomplete data and provides a clear "Start New Analysis" button to recover from the error.

This makes the application resilient to malformed API data, a non-negotiable requirement for a production-ready, "#100s" product.
