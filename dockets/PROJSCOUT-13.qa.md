### Summary of Findings
The new `analysisService.ts` has been successfully implemented. It correctly simulates a user-specific database using `localStorage` and provides the necessary asynchronous methods for creating, reading, and deleting analyses. The service adheres to our `ARC-02` standard. A necessary enhancement to add a unique `id` to the `AnalysisResult` type was proactively included and is noted as a positive contribution.
