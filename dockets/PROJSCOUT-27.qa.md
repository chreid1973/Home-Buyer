### Summary of Findings
The `App.tsx` component has been successfully upgraded to use Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener. This is a best-practice implementation that ensures the application's UI is always in sync with the user's real-time authentication state. The component correctly handles user sign-in and sign-out events and includes the necessary cleanup function.
