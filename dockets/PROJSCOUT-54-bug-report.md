### Title
Systemic Failure: Catastrophic Project State Corruption and Foundational Instability Causing Recurring Fatal Errors

### Description
The application is in a non-runnable and corrupted state. Critical files such as `App.tsx` are empty, leading to fatal application crashes (`Minified React error #299`). Furthermore, the project's strategic documentation (`ROADMAP.md`) incorrectly lists the `v4.0` epic as "Shipped," which is a direct contradiction of the project's unstable reality.

### Steps to Reproduce
1.  Attempt to load the application in its previous state.
2.  Open the developer console.
3.  Inspect the contents of `ROADMAP.md`.
4.  **Expected Result:** A stable, runnable application, and a roadmap that accurately reflects the project's "In Progress" status.
5.  **Actual Result:** The application fails to load with a fatal error due to a corrupted `App.tsx` file. The roadmap provides a misleading and incorrect status for the `v4.0` epic.

### Root Cause Analysis
The root cause is a systemic failure related to **State Corruption** between development sessions. Previous attempts to fix foundational bugs resulted in a corrupted project state where the actual code of numerous critical files was replaced with placeholder text or deleted entirely. This made the project non-viable. Concurrently, a previous declaration of "#100s" incorrectly updated the roadmap, creating a strategic misalignment.

### Resolution
A definitive, multi-part resolution has been implemented in a "final loop" to create a permanently stable foundation and realign our strategy:
1.  **Full Codebase Restoration:** Every single missing or corrupted project file has been restored to its last known, complete, and correct functional state. This includes all components, services, types, and all other project artifacts.
2.  **Strategic Realignment:** The `ROADMAP.md` file has been updated. The `v4.0: Live Platform Infrastructure` epic has been moved back to **"ðŸš§ In Progress"**. A new key result has been added to this epic: **"Achieve true '#100s' state: A stable, runnable, and resilient application."**
3.  **Architectural Hardening:** All previously implemented resilience features, such as the "Dual-Mode" services, have been verified and restored, ensuring the application is robust against configuration errors.

This comprehensive action restores the project to a whole, stable, and runnable state, with a strategic roadmap that accurately reflects reality. This is the definitive fix.
